1. start up all microservices individually, no errors
    1.a. start up router/gateway and connect to microservices, no errors

2. request each microservice directly
    2.a. request math microservices besides initial (input_validate), should it be possible?
    2.b. request non-input microservices with inputs 

2.1. do 2 but through the gateway, ensure results are same

3. request math microservice chain
    3.a. with integer
    3.b. with negative integer
    3.c. with 0
    3.d. with string, should error
    3.e. with nothing, should error
    3.f. with decimal, should error

4. request microservice that doesnt exist, check for graceful error
    4.a. same but through gateway

5. force close a microservice, check for auto restart/spin up

6. close system, check for no errors

General summary of how to get it working

Minikube needs to be using the docker backend
    minikube -p minikube docker-env | source

    minikube start --driver docker

Build the docker container
    cd <DIR_WITH_DOCKERFILE>
    docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> .

    docker build -t is-this-loss docker/loss-container/.
    docker build -t loss-tester docker/loss-test-container/.

    minikube image build -t is-this-loss docker/loss-container/.
    minikube image build -t loss-tester docker/loss-test-container/.

Import into minikube  (this takes forever)

    minikube image load is-this-loss
    minikube image load loss-tester

Run the kubernetes deployment script
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/loss.yml 

    minikube service loss-entrypoint
